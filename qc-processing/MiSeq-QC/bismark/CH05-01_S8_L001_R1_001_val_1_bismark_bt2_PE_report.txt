Bismark report for: CH05-01_S8_L001_R1_001_val_1.fq.gz and CH05-01_S8_L001_R2_001_val_2.fq.gz (version: v0.22.3)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /gscratch/srlab/lhs3/inputs/C_magister/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.6 -p 4 --reorder --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	1303984
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	566145
Mapping efficiency:	43.4% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	461971
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	275868
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	12

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	142029	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	142099	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	140972	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	141033	((converted) bottom strand)
