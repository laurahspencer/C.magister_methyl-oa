Bismark report for: CH10-11_S20_L001_R1_001_val_1.fq.gz and CH10-11_S20_L001_R2_001_val_2.fq.gz (version: v0.22.3)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /gscratch/srlab/lhs3/inputs/C_magister/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.6 -p 4 --reorder --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	2759157
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	1362055
Mapping efficiency:	49.4% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	869649
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	527453
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	19

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	340321	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	342368	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	339178	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	340169	((converted) bottom strand)
