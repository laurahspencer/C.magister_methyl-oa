Bismark report for: CH07-24_S14_L001_R1_001_val_1.fq.gz and CH07-24_S14_L001_R2_001_val_2.fq.gz (version: v0.22.3)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /gscratch/srlab/lhs3/inputs/C_magister/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.6 -p 4 --reorder --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	919688
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	311422
Mapping efficiency:	33.9% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	349854
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	258412
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	12

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	80099	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	75815	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	75677	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	79819	((converted) bottom strand)
