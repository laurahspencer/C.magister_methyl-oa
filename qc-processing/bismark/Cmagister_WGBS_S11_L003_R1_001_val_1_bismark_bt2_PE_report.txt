Bismark report for: /Users/lhs3/Documents/laura-Cmagister/qc-processing/trimgalore/Cmagister_WGBS_S11_L003_R1_001_val_1.fq and /Users/lhs3/Documents/laura-Cmagister/qc-processing/trimgalore/Cmagister_WGBS_S11_L003_R2_001_val_2.fq (version: v0.22.3)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /Users/lhs3/Documents/laura-Cmagister/data/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.6 -p 4 --reorder --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	308740573
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	95208576
Mapping efficiency:	30.8% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	156403212
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	57128785
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	8094

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	26777398	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	20896883	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	20756441	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
